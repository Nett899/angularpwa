# ng2-pwa-starter
Lightweight starter 'ng new' with added app shell features (sw-toolbox, sw-precache, web app manifest) and server-side rendering (angular-universal).

Based on the excellent article by Houssein Djirdeh available here: https://houssein.me/progressive-angular-applications. Check out his working PWA for hackernews here: https://github.com/housseindjirdeh/angular2-hn. Huge kudos!

```
@angular/cli v1.0.0
@angular/core v4.0.1
```

4+ versions of Angular are likely to incorporate all of these features. Until then, this is intended to be an upgraded `ng new <project-name>`.

This is without `ng eject`! Ejecting the webpack config provides with much deeper customisation, but that is not the scope of this starter kit.

```
