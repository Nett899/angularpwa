# ng2-pwa-starter
lightweight starter 'ng init' with added app shell features (sw-toolbox, sw-precache, web app manifest).

```
@angular/cli v1.0.0
@angular/core v4.0.1
```

4+ versions of Angular are likely to incorporate all of these features. Until then, this is intended to be an upgraded `ng init`.
