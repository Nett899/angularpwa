# ng2-pwa-starter
Lightweight starter 'ng new' with added app shell features (sw-toolbox, sw-precache, web app manifest) and server-side rendering (angular-universal).

```
@angular/cli v1.0.0
@angular/core v4.0.1
```

4+ versions of Angular are likely to incorporate all of these features. Until then, this is intended to be an upgraded `ng new <project-name>`.

```
